      <h3>Casual 👜</h3>
      <p>For our first outfit if you prefer pants and something comfortable a cardigan ( either styled as it is or a cardigan to top off a sleeveless top of yours ) and some navy blue jeans. You may add some accessories simply like pearl earrings or hoop earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and don't forget your bag. For the shoes, wear what you are comfortable with but most prefered wear point heels for that fashion look. Your make-up should be a clean make-up routine.</p>
      <p>If you prefer dresses perhaps, you can wear a burgundy colored dress alone or with a blazer or cardigan to top it off. For this outfit accessories is a must! Go all out for it earrings, necklaces, a hat, and a bag. For your shoes, you should wear some point heels to top off that look. Your make-up should be a clean make-up routine. </p>

      <h3>Formal 🪭</h3>
      <p>For formal events, if you prefer pants, you could wear any colored silk off shoulder top and some trousers. That gives off a rich type of vibe with your hair styled properly down or slicked in a bun. Minimize the accessories on this one, simply like pearl earring would do and some bracelets just not too much to ober power your outfit and remember this is a formal event, not a party. For your shoes most prefered wear heels. This enhances the whole entire look as you would look more formal wearing heels. Your make-up should be a clean make-up routine. </p>
      <p>If you prefer dresses, either a black or burgundy backless laced up at the back would be a good formal outfit for formal dinings at formal resturants just be ready to get cold easily and bring a blazer that would fit the entire look. This is a minimalist fashion look, go for your hair down? It would look good, half bun? It would also look good. Minimize accessories on this one too. This is for formal evens hoop earrings or pearl earring would do with a bracelet and necklace to top it off. Wearing heels for your shoes are a must! Your make-up should be a clean make-up routine.  </p>

      <h3>Party 🪩</h3>        
      <p>For parties, if you prefer wearing skirts, a fancy silver miniskirt and a off shoulder longsleeve would be good for a party. Go all out on accessories but still look presentative, wear stockings ( preferably black ) some boots or heels, hoop earrings bracelets a chocker or necklace or leave without anything on your neck would still look good. Your make-up would look best if it was just a simple clean make-up with an eyeliner I suppose to still have that party vibe in you.   </p>
      <p>If you prefer dresses, a mini dress either sleeveless or with a strap then a leather jacket for the party look. Go all in for accessories but not too much, hoop earrings, bracelets a necklace, and a bag. For your shoes, wear boots or heels for an enhanced party look. For your make-up, a simple clean make-up look would be amazing, but if you prefer looking more party like, a smoky eye make up would be the look for you.</p>
